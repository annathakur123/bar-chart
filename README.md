### 🌍 Data Visualization Project – Top 10 Most Populous Countries (2020)

### 📌 Project Summary

As part of my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**, I undertook a project to create insightful visualizations of population data using Python. The objective was to apply data visualization techniques to real-world datasets, enhance my analytical skills, and present the findings in a clear and informative way.

Using **2020 population data from the World Bank**, I developed:

* 📊 A **bar chart** showcasing the populations of the 10 most populous countries
* 📈 A **histogram** illustrating the population distribution pattern

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies

* **Python** 🐍
* **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
* **Seaborn & Matplotlib** – Data visualization libraries
* **Spyder (via Anaconda Navigator)** – IDE used for coding and visualization

---

### 📈 Key Takeaways

* Learned how to clean and organize real-world datasets for visualization
* Gained insights into when to use bar charts vs. histograms
* Practiced enhancing plots with colors, labels, and layout adjustments for better readability
* Strengthened my GitHub skills by uploading code, images, and writing documentation
